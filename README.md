# Coding Interviews

A curated repository for coding interview preparation. It organizes practice problems and study materials across popular categories, starting with Python solutions for the classic Blind75 list and leaving room for broader data structures and algorithms coverage.

## Repository Structure
- **Blind75/**: Python solutions to the Blind 75 interview problems, named by their LeetCode question numbers.
- **Data Structures/**: Space for notes, implementations, and practice problems focused on core data structures.
- **Algorithms/**: Space for algorithm primers, patterns, and problem solutions beyond the Blind75 set.

## Getting Started
- Browse the `Blind75/` directory to review the existing solutions.
- Add new language solutions or topics by creating subfolders within `Data Structures/` or `Algorithms/`.

## Contributing
This repository tracks ongoing interview preparation. Contributions that expand coverage with clear explanations or additional language solutions are welcome.

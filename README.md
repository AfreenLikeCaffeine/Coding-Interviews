# Coding Interviews

A curated repository for coding interview preparation. It organizes practice problems and study materials across popular categories, starting with Python solutions for the classic Blind75 list while expanding to other must-know interview topics.

## Repository Structure
- **Blind75/**: Python solutions to the Blind 75 interview problems, named by their LeetCode question numbers (with non-Blind75 standouts collected elsewhere).
- **Important questions/**: Additional high-value problems that sit outside the classic Blind75 list.
- **Data Structures/**: Space for notes, implementations, and practice problems focused on core data structures.
- **Algorithms/**: Space for algorithm primers, patterns, and problem solutions beyond the Blind75 set.

## Getting Started
- Browse the `Blind75/` directory to review the existing solutions.
- Add new language solutions or topics by creating subfolders within `Data Structures/` or `Algorithms/`.

## Contributing
This repository tracks ongoing interview preparation. Contributions that expand coverage with clear explanations or additional language solutions are welcome.
